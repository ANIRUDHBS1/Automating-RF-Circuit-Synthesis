# Automating-RF-Circuit-Synthesis

This repository contains the netlists and Python code used in the automation of circuit synthesis. This work has been done under the guidance of Prof. Sankaran Aniruddhan over a period of one year from June 2023 to May 2024. This work has been formally credited under EE4902 : Mini Project 2 in the Jan-May 2024 semester at IIT Madras.

The topologies I worked on during this period were the Noise Cancelling LNA and the Resistive Feedback LNA. The simulator used is Cadence Virtuoso.
